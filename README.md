# ML-Learning-Journey-
# 🤖 ML-Learning-Journey

My complete **Machine Learning roadmap**, from absolute basics (stats, probability) to ML models, evaluation, and real-world projects.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `01_Statistics-and-Probability`: Hypothesis testing, distributions, CLT, etc.
- `02_Data-Wrangling-and-EDA`: Pandas, EDA, data cleaning
- `03_Feature-Engineering`: Scaling, encoding, transformation
- `04_Machine-Learning-Basics`: Core ML models (regression, classification)
- `05_Model-Evaluation`: Accuracy, precision, F1, ROC, etc.
- `06_Projects`: End-to-end ML projects with real datasets

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python, Pandas, Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter / Google Colab

## 📌 Purpose

I built this repo as my personal notebook to master Machine Learning, with clean notebooks, notes, and projects. This is an evolving journey!
